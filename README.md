# NoFuture
No Future Z80 game for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum 48K
High level report:

Loading:
Type “J” for “Load” to appear, then keep your
finger on the “Symbol Shift” key and press “P”
twice. This should display LOAD “” on the screen.
Then press the Enter key and the computer  will
load the tape after you press the play button
on the tape recorder.

A group of UFO hunters have stumbled on a
hidden invisible portal in the sky. The portal 
appears to be a gateway into another dimension
and when it opens, it is letting in alien ships that
are extracting H2O (Water) and O2 (Oxygen) from
our dimension and taking these resources into 
their own dimension through the portal.

We must put a stop to this grave situation before
the aliens take all of our water and air resources.
Because, if these resources deplete in our
dimension, there will be NO FUTURE!!!!!!! 

You must move your ship (at the bottom of
the screen) left and right to dodge the aliens and
their fire. Multiple keys across the keyboard are
assigned to left , right, and fire control. 

You must shoot the aliens down before they
reach the bottom of the screen to grab the 
water resources.

To move left use keys Q,E,T,U,O,Z,C, and N.
To move right use keys W,R,Y,I,P,X,V,B, and M.
To Fire use keys A,S,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,0,and ENTER

When an alien reaches the bottom of the
screen, it will turn blue to show that it has
collected water. You must shoot it down before
it reaches the portal at the top of the screen. 
As soon as it enters the portal at the top of the 
screen, that resource will be gone forever. 
The meter on the left of the play area shows 
the remaining H2O. As soon as it reaches the
bottom of the meter, you will lose a life.

The O2 meter is located on the right of the play
area. This will slowly drop until you have 
destroyed all aliens for the current level. The
portal is open while the level is playing. So O2
will leak out into the aliens dimension. When
the O2 meter drops to the bottom, you will lose
a life.

You start with three lives and you can earn 
more lives by collecting bonuses that drop 
when you shoot down an alien.

Notes:

This game was written between 1st Dec 2013 and 12th August 2024.
I had to go to hospital and to pass the boredom I started to make
notes for a 48K Spectrum shooter engine schema on my iPhone using
the Notes app. When I finally got home, I converted the notes into
Zeus assembler on my laptop. The game developed from there and 9
months later, I had a finished game.

I hate the beep sound on the 48K spectrum and wanted some arcade
sounds. So I added in some code for the Fuller sound addon. To 
use this, you don't need to select Fuller game control. That only
selects the controls and does not affect the sound. The Fuller sound
works well with the Spectaculator emulator.
